  abstract  = {{A very general class of sampling methods without replacement and
	with unequal probabilities is proposed. It consists of splitting
	the inclusion probability vector into several new inclusion probability
	vectors. One of these vectors. is chosen randomly;:thus, the initial
	problem is reduced to another sampling problem with unequal probabilities.
	This splitting is then repeated on; these new vectors of inclusion
	probabilities; at each step,he sampling problem is reduced to a simpler
	problem. The simplicity of this technique allows one to generate
	easily new sampling procedures with unequal probabilities. The splitting
	method also generalises well-known methods such as the Midzuno method,
	the elimination procedure and the Chao procedure. Next, a sufficient
	condition is given in order that a splitting method satisfies the
	Sen-Yates-Grundy condition; Finally, it is shown that the elimination
	procedure satisfies the Gabler sufficient condition.}},

  abstract = {Abstract The optimisation of spatial sampling by simulated annealing has been demonstrated and applied for a range of objective functions. In practice more than one objective function may be important for sampling, and there may be complex trade-offs between them. In this paper it is shown how a multi-objective optimisation algorithm can be applied to a spatial sampling problem. This generates a set of solutions which is non-dominated (no one solution does better than any other on all objective functions). These solutions represent different feasible trade-offs between the objective functions, and a subset might be practically acceptable. The algorithm is applied to a hypothetical example of sampling for a regional mean with the variance of the mean and the total distance travelled between sample points as the two objective functions. The solutions represent a transition of sample arrays from a loose grid to a tight loop. The potential to develop this approach and apply it to other spatial sampling problems is discussed.},

	of this strategy is the support of the basic soil observation: the
	size and shape of the volume of material that is collected and then
	analysed to return a single soil datum. Many, but not all, soil sampling
	schemes use aggregate supports in which material from a set of more
	than one soil cores, arranged in a given configuration, is aggregated
	and thoroughly mixed prior to analysis. In this paper, it is shown
	how the spatial statistics of soil information, collected on an aggregate
	support, can be computed from the covariance function of the soil
	variable on a core support (treated as point support). This is done
	via what is called here the discrete regularization of the core-support
	function. It is shown how discrete regularization can be used to
	compute the variance of soil sample means and to quantify the consistency
	of estimates made by sampling then re-sampling a monitoring network,
	given uncertainty in the precision with which sample sites are relocated.
	These methods are illustrated using data on soil organic carbon content
	from a transect in central England. Two aggregate supports, both
	based on a 20 m 20 m square, are compared with core support. It is
	shown that both the precision and the consistency of data collected
	on an aggregate support are better than data on a core support. This
	has implications for the design of sampling schemes for soil inventory
	and monitoring.}},

   science. In the geosciences they are used to discover the important
   spatial scales on which properties vary. However, while the practical
   advantages and disadvantages of various nested designs have been
   discussed, no attempt has been made to optimise nested sampling schemes.
   This paper shows how an optimal nested sampling design can be found by a
   method of numerical combinatorial optimisation: simulated annealing. The
   sample design is optimised over a space of possible designs for a fixed
   sample size and predetermined levels (spatial scales). The objective
   function for optimisation is based on the expected covariance matrix for
   errors in the estimates of variance components, and so depends on what
   those components are. By simulation it was shown that optimised sampling
   schemes can detect scale-dependent variance components with common
   requirements for statistical power on smaller total sample sizes than
   are required with commonly used spatially nested sample designs such as
   the balanced design. Although the optimised design depends on the
   underlying covariance structure, sampling designs can be identified that
   perform better than the commonly used ones over a wide range of
   conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   investigate variation in the content of copper, chromium and uranium. A
   nested sampling design was used. The data showed significant relations
   between the content of copper and uranium in the soil and its organic
   matter content, and a significant spatial trend in uranium content with
   distance from the tailings. Soil pH was not significantly related to any
   of the metals. The variance components associated with different scales
   of the sample design had large confidence intervals, but it was possible
   to show that the random variation was spatially dependent for all
   spatial models, whether for variation around a constant mean, or with a
   mean given by a linear effect of organic matter or distance to the
   tailings. For copper, we showed that a fractal or multifractal random
   model, with equal variance components for scales in a logarithmic
   progression, could be rejected for the model of variation around the
   fixed mean. The inclusion of organic matter as an explanatory factor
   meant that the fractal model could no longer be rejected, suggesting
   that the effect of organic matter results in spatial variation that is
   not scale invariant. It was shown, taking uranium as a case study, that
   further spatially nested sampling to estimate scale-dependent variance
   components, or to test a non-fractal model with adequate power, would
   require in the order of 200-250 samples in total.
   Highlights
   Sampling was undertaken to investigate spatial variation of metal
   content in soil near mine tailings.
   Chromium and uranium were related to soil organic matter content;
   uranium showed a spatial trend.
   Spatial variation was scale dependent, variation of copper was not
   scale-invariant.
   Characterizing random spatial variation requires substantial sample
   effort.}},

   name={''}ejs\_1363\_mu1.gif{''} type={''}gif{''}/>60 m) and analysed for
   particle size, organic matter content, pH, soluble P and various
   fractions of selected metals. Variance components were estimated by
   residual maximum likelihood. The uncertainty of variance estimates was
   characterized by the Fisher Information matrix and likelihood joint
   confidence regions. The latter approach was used for the first time to
   characterize uncertainties of variance estimates in spatial nested
   sampling. Likelihood ratio tests showed that all variables were
   spatially auto-correlated but the allocation of the variance to specific
   spatial scales was highly uncertain. For most variables, at least one
   variance component could not be estimated precisely because the profile
   likelihood was either flat or the maximum lay on the boundary of the
   parameter space. Uncertainty estimates derived from the Fisher
   Information matrix either could not be computed or were unrealistic in
   these cases. Likelihood joint confidence regions gave more realistic
   uncertainty estimates. Joint confidence regions for accumulated variance
   components showed that the shape of the estimated variograms was poorly
   defined for most variables. Simulations indicated that poor
   identification of variance components might be a general problem of
   nested sampling surveys, which has been under-estimated in the past.
   Hence, our work provides some incentive for re-examining the statistical
   properties of the methodology.}},

  abstract  = {{Sample schemes used in geostatistical surveys must be suitable for
	both variogram estimation and kriging. Previously schemes have been
	optimised for one of these steps in isolation. Ordinary kriging generally
	requires the sampling locations to be evenly dispersed over the region.
	Variogram estimation requires a more irregular pattern of sampling
	locations since comparisons must be made between measurements separated
	by all lags up to and beyond the range of spatial correlation. Previous
	studies have not considered how to combine these optimised schemes
	into a single survey and how to decide what proportion of sampling
	effort should be devoted to variogram estimation and what proportion
	devoted to kriging An expression for the total error in a geostatistical
	survey accounting for uncertainty due to both ordinary kriging and
	variogram uncertainty is derived. In the same manner as the kriging
	variance, this expression is a function of the variogram but not
	of the sampled response data. If a particular variogram is assumed
	the total error in a geostatistical survey may be estimated prior
	to sampling. We can therefore design an optimal sample scheme for
	the combined processes of variogram estimation and ordinary kriging
	by minimising this expression. The minimisation is achieved by spatial
	simulated annealing. The resulting sample schemes ensure that the
	region is fairly evenly covered but include some close pairs to analyse
	the spatial correlation over short distances. The form of these optimal
	sample schemes is sensitive to the assumed variogram. Therefore a
	Bayesian approach is adopted where, rather than assuming a single
	variogram, we minimise the expected total error over a distribution
	of plausible variograms. This is computationally expensive so a strategy
	is suggested to reduce the number of computations required.}},

  abstract  = {{This paper demonstrates for the first time the use of Markov Chain
	Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation for parameter inference in model-based
	soil geostatistics. We implemented the recently developed DiffeRential
	Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm to jointly summarize
	the posterior distribution of variogram parameters and the coefficients
	of a linear spatial model, and derive estimates of predictive uncertainty.
	The DREAM method runs multiple different Markov chains in parallel
	and jumps in each chain are generated from a discrete proposal distribution
	containing a fixed multiple of the difference of the states of randomly
	chosen pairs of other chains. This approach automatically scales
	the orientation and scale of the proposal distribution, and is especially
	designed to maintain detailed balance and ergodicity, thereby generating
	an exact approximation of the posterior probability density function
	(pdf) of the parameters of the linear model and variogram. This approach
	is tested using three different data sets from Australia involving
	variogram estimation of soil thickness, kriging of soil pH, and spatial
	prediction of soil organic carbon content. The results showed some
	advantages of MCMC over the conventional method of moments and residual
	maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. The posterior pdf derived with
	MCMC conveys important information about parameter uncertainty, multi-dimensional
	parameter correlation, and thus how many significant parameters are
	warranted by the calibration data. Parameter uncertainty constitutes
	only a small part of total prediction uncertainty for the case studies
	considered here. The prediction accuracies using MCMC and REML are
	similar. The variogram estimated using conventional approaches (method
	of moments, and without simulation) lies within the 95\% prediction
	uncertainty interval of the posterior distribution derived with DREAM.
	Altogether our results show that conventional kriging and regression-kriging
	still remain a viable option for production mapping. (C) 2011 Elsevier

  abstract      = {For baselining and to assess changes in soil organic carbon (C) we need efficient soil sampling designs and methods for measuring C stocks. Conventional analytical methods are time-consuming, expensive and impractical, particularly for measuring at depth. Here we demonstrate the use of proximal soil sensors for estimating the total soil organic C stocks and their accuracies in the 0-10 cm, 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm layers, and for mapping the stocks in each of the three depth layers across 2837 ha of grazing land. Sampling locations were selected by probability sampling, which allowed design-based, model-assisted and model-based estimation of the total organic C stock in the study area. We show that spectroscopic and gamma attenuation sensors can produce accurate measures of soil organic C and bulk density at the sampling locations, in this case every 5 cm to a depth of 1 m. Interpolated data from a mobile multisensor platform were used as covariates in Cubist to map soil organic C. The Cubist map was subsequently used as a covariate in the model-assisted and model-based estimation of the total organic C stock. The design-based, model-assisted and model-based estimates of the total organic C stocks in the study area were similar. However, the variances of the model-assisted and model-based estimates were smaller compared to those of the design-based method. The model-based method produced the smallest variances for all three depth layers. Maps helped to assess variability in the C stock of the study area. The contribution of the spectroscopic model prediction error to our uncertainty about the total soil organic C stocks was relatively small. We found that in soil under unimproved pastures, remnant vegetation and forests there is good rationale for measuring soil organic C beyond the commonly recommended depth of 0-30 cm. © 2015.},

The first part described the physical properties (Ballabio et al., 2016) while this second part includes the following chemical properties: pH, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), calcium carbonates (CaCO3), C:N ratio, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The LUCAS survey collected harmonised data on changes in land cover and the state of land use for the European Union (EU). Among the 270,000 land use and cover observations selected for field visit, approximately 20,000 soil samples were collected in 24 EU Member States in 2009 together with more than 2000 samples from Bulgaria and Romania in 2012. The chemical properties maps for the European Union were produced using Gaussian process regression (GPR) models. GPR was selected for its capacity to assess model uncertainty and the possibility of adding prior knowledge in the form of covariance functions to the model. The derived maps will establish baselines that will help monitor soil quality and provide guidance to agro-environmental research and policy developments in the European Union.},
